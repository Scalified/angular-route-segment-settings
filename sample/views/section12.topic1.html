<div>
    <p>This is Topic1 template, used for sections: "section1", "section2". It's configured this way:</p>
    <pre>
    {
        section: ['section1', 'section2'],
        topic: ['topic1'],
        templateUrl: 'views/section.topic1.html'
    },
    </pre>
    <p>That means, that this template will be used if current route has both parameters "section" and "topic", where
        "section" must equals either "section1" or "section2" and "topic" has to be "topic1".
    </p>
